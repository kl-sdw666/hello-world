# hello-world
Just making my first repository on GitHub. Better late than never?

I'm a CompSci major in my senior year. I'm trying to dust off those 1-3 year skills and create some meaningful projects
before I enter the workforce for real. I'm hoping this will give me the edge against the competition and show employers 
that I'm as motivated and passionate as I say I am.
